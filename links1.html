    <h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>
    <p>Someone thought it would be funny to give my English husband a DVD box set of the 2005 Ashes series as a Christmas present that year - the joke being on Australian me. I scowled whenever I stumbled upon it during house moves across two continents, incredulous that it survived a charity shop box or bin bag on countless occasions. It now sits on our bookshelf.</p>
    <h2 id="section2">Section 2</h2>
    <p>Who would have thought I would be the first one in the house to watch it, 15 years later, in an attempt to refuel a hate that had been shoved away at the bottom of a drawer long ago, like those bloody DVDs should have been? The only explanation I have for not throwing them out is that they weren't mine to dispose of, and it was, after all, the greatest series of them all.</p>
    <h2 id="section3">Section 3</h2>
    <p>As I gaze at the cover, past the main image of a grinning Michael Vaughan, I see the subject of my wrath: a maniacally roaring, champagne-spraying, devastatingly good Andrew Flintoff. I am reminded that there is something to love, in spite of myself, about Freddie.</p>
